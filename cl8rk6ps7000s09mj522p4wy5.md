# How to Contribute to Open Source Projects for the First Time using GitHub

Contributing to Open Source opens up lots of opportunities for the Developers as it acts as a proof of work when applying for jobs and there are high chances that Companies themselves would reach out to you for a Job Role via GitHub if your profile happens to be Good Enough.


Assuming you have installed Git Bash and have a GitHub Account lets Start !


## 1. Forking the Project on GitHub
Go the Repository you wish to contribute and fork it

```
cd [repository-name]
```

### **Example:**
![egcontribution.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1664713360628/qcRIgOEQB.png align="left")
We added Code13.txt file as a Contribution to the project



## 6.Adding the Upstream Link


- Go the Original Repository from where you have forked ( *known as Upstream* ) and copy it's link. You'll be able to locate it from your repository itself.

```
git remote add upstream [link]
``` 




## 7. Create a New Branch for the Project Contribution and Checkout to it.

- It's always a Good Practice to create a new branch for every commit that we make.

- We'll commit the changes on that branch.

- Branch Name should depict what change have you done *(again a good practice)*

![branchname.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1664718682473/Lgj_zPgrt.png align="left")

```
git branch [branch-name]
``` 




## 8. Checkout to the created Branch and Stage the Changes
Checkout to the newly created branch and stage it using add command.

### Checkout: *moving the head to that branch*

### Stage: *Start tracking those files in order to Commit*
